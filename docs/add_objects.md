# Adding Objects
Import object to Isaac Sim with the use of the GUI and save as .usd.
## Steps to Add objects:
1) Prepare the .usd objects (clean colliders, correct masses or densities, etc.)
2) Add the .json files describing the object grasps to the grasps directory.
3) Test the object's collider preferably by visualizing within the simulation.
